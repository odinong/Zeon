# Zeon Mod Menu for Gorilla Tag

Zeon is a powerful mod menu designed for **Gorilla Tag**, offering a range of exciting features and enhancements to elevate your gameplay. With Zeon, you can explore new options, tweak your experience, and enjoy customizations that make your time in Gorilla Tag even more fun and dynamic.

## Why Open Source?

I created Zeon to be an **open-source** mod menu so anyone can access and modify it, but I also want to make it clear that I prefer people ask before using any part of the code. While I'm happy to share my work, I believe in giving credit where it's due. If you want to use or adapt my code, please **reach out** first, and we can discuss it. Respecting the work behind Zeon is important, and I want to ensure it stays that way.

## Can I Use Zeon’s Code?

I ask that you **contact me first** if you'd like to use or modify any part of Zeon’s code. While I’m open to collaboration and sharing knowledge, I prefer not to have my work taken without permission. Feel free to reach out through the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/your_discord_invite), or message me via my GitHub if you're interested in working with the code.
