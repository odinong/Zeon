# Zeon Mod Menu for Gorilla Tag

Zeon is a mod menu for **Gorilla Tag**, designed to bring powerful features and customization options to your gameplay. Whether you want to enhance your experience or experiment with new features, Zeon offers everything you need. Created by the Zeon team, this menu brings a unique and fun modding experience.

## Why make Zeon open-sourced?
Zeon was made open-sourced to provide a resource for learning developers and modders looking to understand or contribute to Gorilla Tag modding. By sharing the code, I hope to foster a more open and collaborative modding culture. I believe that learning how to mod should be accessible to everyone, free from obfuscation, paywalls, and viruses/RATs. I encourage other developers to contribute and create alongside us.

## Can I use your code?
Preferrably no, if you would like to take any type of code from this, please contact me on discord, the notificationlib is free to use though. If you need help or want to discuss any ideas, feel free to reach out through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9ku2XQq7Wr).
